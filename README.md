# Met Images

Script to download Met painting images by artist name. Requires that you have already downloaded the entire csv file created by The Met which can be downloaded here: https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess.

The script searches the csv file and then goes to a webpage on the met website to find a link to download the image. Once it has found the image link, it proceeds to download the images for the artist.
